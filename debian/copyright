 This is a prologue that allows to run a perl script as an executable
 on systems that are compliant to a POSIX version before POSIX:2017.
 On such systems, the usual invocation of an executable through execlp()
 or execvp() fails with ENOEXEC if it is a script that does not start
 with a #! line.  The script interpreter mentioned in the #! line has
 to be /bin/sh, because on GuixSD systems that is the only program that
 has a fixed file name.  The second line is essential for perl and is
 also useful for editing this file in Emacs.  The next two lines below
 are valid code in both sh and perl.  When executed by sh, they re-execute
 the script through the perl program found in $PATH.  The '-x' option
 is essential as well; without it, perl would re-execute the script
 through /bin/sh.  When executed by perl, the next two lines are a no-op.

 NOTES:
 .
 A program that uses alloca, dynamic arrays, or large local
 variables may extend the stack by more than a page at a time.  If
 so, when the stack overflows the operating system may not detect
 the overflow until the program uses the array, and this module may
 incorrectly report a program error instead of a stack overflow.
 .
 To avoid this problem, allocate only small objects on the stack; a
 program should be OK if it limits single allocations to a page or
 less.  Allocate larger arrays in static storage, or on the heap
 (e.g., with malloc).  Yes, this is a pain, but we don't know of any
 better solution that is portable.
 .
 No attempt has been made to deal with multithreaded applications.

 This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: https://git-scm.com/.
 It may be run two ways:
 - from a git repository in which the "git describe" command below
 produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
 - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .tarball-version file, which
 presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .tarball-version".
 .
 In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will need two
 separate generated version string files:
 .
 .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not in
 a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were learned at
 the last time autoconf was run, and used by git-version-gen.  Must not
 be present in either $(srcdir) or $(builddir) for git-version-gen to
 give accurate answers during normal development with a checked out tree,
 but must be present in a tarball when there is no version control system.
 Therefore, it cannot be used in any dependencies.  GNUmakefile has
 hooks to force a reconfigure at distribution time to get the value
 correct, without penalizing normal development with extra reconfigures.
 .
 .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
 tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that don't
 want to depend on config.h but do want to track version changes.
 Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you want to rebuild
 files to pick up a version string change; and leave it stale to
 minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to configure sources.
 .
 As with any generated file in a VC'd directory, you should add
 /.version to .gitignore, so that you don't accidentally commit it.
 .tarball-version is never generated in a VC'd directory, so needn't
 be listed there.
 .
 Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
 automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note that
 since configure.ac no longer includes a version string, Makefile rules
 should not depend on configure.ac for version updates).

 1 Introduction
 **************
 .
 Given one or more patterns, ‘grep’ searches input files for matches to
 the patterns.  When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to
 standard output (by default), or produces whatever other sort of output
 you have requested with options.
 .
 Though ‘grep’ expects to do the matching on text, it has no limits on
 input line length other than available memory, and it can match
 arbitrary characters within a line.  If the final byte of an input file
 is not a newline, ‘grep’ silently supplies one.  Since newline is also a
 separator for the list of patterns, there is no way to match newline
 characters in a text.

 2 Invoking ‘grep’
 *****************
 .
 The general synopsis of the ‘grep’ command line is
 .
 grep [OPTION...] [PATTERNS] [FILE...]
 .
 There can be zero or more OPTION arguments, and zero or more FILE
 arguments.  The PATTERNS argument contains one or more patterns
 separated by newlines, and is omitted when patterns are given via the
 ‘-e PATTERNS’ or ‘-f FILE’ options.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted
 when ‘grep’ is used in a shell command.
 .
 * Menu:
 .
 * Command-line Options::        Short and long names, grouped by category.
 * Environment Variables::       POSIX, GNU generic, and GNU grep specific.
 * Exit Status::                 Exit status returned by ‘grep’.
 * grep Programs::               ‘grep’ programs.

 POSIX states that when the character is found, memchr must not read extra
 bytes in an overestimated length (for example, where memchr is used to
 implement strnlen).  However, we use a safe word read to provide a speedup.

 Summary:
 .
 All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
 is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
 very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
 Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
 evaluated MANY times!!
 .
 These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
 small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
 by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
 been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
 stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
 stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.
 .
 These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you

 Mike Haertel wrote the main program and the dfa and kwset matchers.
 .
 Isamu Hasegawa wrote the POSIX regular expression matcher, which is
 part of the GNU C Library and is distributed as part of GNU grep for
 use on non-GNU systems.  Ulrich Drepper, Paul Eggert, Paolo Bonzini,
 Stanislav Brabec, Assaf Gordon, Jakub Jelinek, Jim Meyering, Arnold
 Robbins, Andreas Schwab and Florian Weimer also contributed to this
 matcher.
 .
 Arthur David Olson contributed the heuristics for finding fixed substrings
 at the end of dfa.c.
 .
 Henry Spencer wrote the original test suite from which grep's was derived.
 Scott Anderson invented the Khadafy test.
 .
 David MacKenzie wrote the automatic configuration software used to
 produce the configure script.
 .
 The idea of using Boyer-Moore type algorithms to quickly filter out
 non-matching text before calling the regexp matcher was originally due
 to James Woods.  He also contributed some code to early versions of
 GNU grep.
 .
 Mike Haertel would like to thank Andrew Hume for many fascinating
 discussions of string searching issues over the years.  Hume and
 Sunday's excellent paper on fast string searching describes some of
 the history of the subject, as well as providing exhaustive
 performance analysis of various implementation alternatives.
 The inner loop of GNU grep is similar to Hume & Sunday's recommended
 "Tuned Boyer Moore" inner loop (see the Hume & Sunday citation in
 the grep manual's "Performance" chapter).
 .
 Arnold Robbins contributed to improve dfa.[ch]. In fact
 it came straight from gawk-3.0.3 with small editing and fixes.
 .
 Norihiro Tanaka contributed many performance improvements and other
 fixes, particularly to multi-byte matchers.
 .
 Paul Eggert contributed support for recursive grep, as well as several
 performance improvements such as searching file holes efficiently.
 .
 Many other folks contributed.  See THANKS; if someone is omitted
 please file a bug report.
 .
 Alain Magloire maintained GNU grep until version 2.5e.
 .
 Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkränzer <bero@arklinux.org> maintained GNU grep until
 version 2.5.1, ie. from Sep 2001 till 2003.
 .
 Stepan Kasal <kasal@ucw.cz> maintained GNU grep since Feb 2004.
 .
 Tony Abou-Assaleh <taa@acm.org> maintains GNU grep since Oct 2007.
 .
 Jim Meyering <jim@meyering.net> and Paolo Bonzini <bonzini@gnu.org>
 began maintaining GNU grep in Nov 2009.  Paolo bowed out in 2012.

 This is GNU grep, the "fastest grep in the west" (we hope).  All
 bugs reported in previous releases have been fixed.  Many exciting new
 bugs have probably been introduced in this revision.

 GNU grep is provided "as is" with no warranty.  The exact terms
 under which you may use and (re)distribute this program are detailed
 in the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.
 .
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher
 hybridized with Boyer-Moore and Aho-Corasick searches for fixed
 strings that eliminate impossible text from being considered by the
 full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at every
 character.  The result is typically many times faster than traditional
 implementations.  (Regular expressions containing back-references will
 run more slowly, however.)

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
 .
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.
 .
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.
 .
   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 .
   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.
 .
   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 .
   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   0. Definitions.
 .
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
     "keep intact all notices".
 .
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
     work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
     customarily used for software interchange.
 .
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
     with subsection 6b.
 .
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
     charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or
 .
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
 combination as such.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
